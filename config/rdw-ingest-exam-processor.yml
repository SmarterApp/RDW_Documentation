# Annotated configuration for RDW Exam Processor
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-exam-processor so this file should be named
# rdw-ingest-exam-processor.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is expected to be
# exposed only in a private subnet. Use the default settings unless you really know what you
# are doing.
