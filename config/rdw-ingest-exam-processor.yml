# Annotated configuration for RDW Exam Processor
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-exam-processor so this file should be named
# rdw-ingest-exam-processor.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is expected to be
# exposed only in a private subnet. Use the default settings unless you really know what you
# are doing.

# Transformations are applied to exam payloads before they are parsed and
# loaded as TDSReports. They are intended as a last resort when the 3rd party
# submitting the results are providing bad or malformed data. It is better,
# of course, to have conforming input without needing transformation.
# Currently only transformations using XSLT 1.0 and 2.0 are supported.
# There are NO default settings for this: by default no transformations will
# loaded or applied.
