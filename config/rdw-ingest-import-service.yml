# Annotated configuration for RDW Import Service.
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-import-service so this file should be named
# rdw-ingest-import-service.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# Archive configuration
# The import service archives a copy of all accepted payloads. Although the location may be a
# local file system the preferred solution is to write to AWS S3, which requires credentials.
# For S3, the root should be the protocol and the bucket, e.g. s3://my-archive-bucket.
# The AWS access key should be for a programmatic AWS user. The secretKey should be encrypted.
# The bucket should be in the same region as the deployment (to reduce costs).
# There are no default values for these properties and they must be provided.

# expected to be exposed only in a private subnet.

#reporting:
#  # The client and state code is used when validating roles/permissions granted in ART.
#  client: SBAC
#  state:
#    code: CA

# OAuth2 configuration.
# The user of the REST API must have data load permissions granted at the client or state level,
# so the client and state values must be set to match the permissions granted in ART.
# The OAuth2 URL is used to fetch info for the token, so it must have a placeholder for the token.
# For example, https://host/auth/oauth2/tokeninfo?access_token={access_token}. There is no default
# value for the URL, it must be provided. The permission-service end-point should correspond to the
# RESTful interface, for example https://host/rest.
