# Annotated configuration for RDW Task Service
#
# The spring application name is rdw-ingest-task-service so this file should be
# named rdw-ingest-task-service.yml when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is expected to be
# exposed only in a private subnet. Use the default settings unless you really know what you
# are doing.

# Task configuration.
# By default, all tasks are disabled.
# The cron syntax is slightly different than standard linux cron syntax. The pattern is a list
# of six single space-separated fields: representing second, minute, hour, day, month, weekday.
# Month and weekday names can be given as the first three letters of the English names.
# Example patterns:
#   0 0 10 * * *           10 AM every day
#   0 0 * * * *            the top of every hour of every day
#   */10 * * * * *         every ten seconds
#   0 0 8-10 * * *         8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day
#   0 0 6,19 * * *         6:00 AM and 7:00 PM every day
#   0 0/30 8-10 * * *      8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, 10:00 and 10:30 every day
