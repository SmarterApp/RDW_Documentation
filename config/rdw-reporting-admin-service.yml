# Annotated configuration for RDW Admin Service.
#
# The spring application name is rdw-reporting-admin-service so this file should be named
# rdw-reporting-admin-service when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is
# expected to be exposed only in a private subnet.

# Archive configuration
# Student group upload payloads are archived. Although the location may be a local file system the
# preferred solution is to write to AWS S3, which requires credentials. For S3, the root should be
# the protocol and the bucket, e.g. s3://my-archive-bucket. The AWS access key should be for a
# programmatic AWS user. The secretKey should be encrypted. The bucket should be in the same
# region as the deployment (to reduce costs).
# There are no default values for these properties and they must be provided.
