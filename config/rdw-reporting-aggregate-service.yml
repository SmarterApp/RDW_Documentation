# Annotated configuration for RDW Aggregate Service.
#
# The spring application name is rdw-reporting-aggregate-service so this file should
# be named rdw-reporting-aggregate-service when served by the configuration server.
#
# Properties that have a reasonable default value are commented out.
# Other properties are not commented out and must be provided.

# The actuator end-point is on a different port with no security because it is
# expected to be exposed only in a private subnet.

  # Report archive configuration.
  # Although the location may be a local file system the preferred solution is to write to AWS S3,
  # which requires credentials. For S3, the root should be the protocol and the bucket, e.g. s3://my-archive-bucket.
  # The AWS access key should be for a programmatic AWS user. The secretKey should be encrypted.
  # The bucket should be in the same region as the deployment (to reduce costs).
  # There are no default values for these properties and they must be provided.

  # The repository cache should be cleared whenever new data is migrated. Typically this is daily so the default
  # is to clear the cache every day at 2:00 am (GMT). This setting should be coordinated to happen after the migration
  # cron setting in rdw-ingest-migrate-olap.yml.

  # Target Report configuration
#  target-report:

  # The target reports display "Insufficient Data" when the standard error of the calculation is greater than 0.2.

  # only be changed if you really know why you are changing it.
#    insufficient-data-cutoff: 0.2

  # Setting this to 0 means it will always be shown (even with a single student).
