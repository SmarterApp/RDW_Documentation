  # When a user is logged into SSO but does not have proper permissions to access the reporting application
  # an Access Denied page is displayed.  The default is a basic page presented within the application.
  # To provide an external page/site use the "redirect:url" format.
  # For example, redirect:http://external-site.com/access-denied
#  access-denied-url: forward:/assets/public/access-denied.html

  # When a user is not logged in and accesses the root of the web application, they are presented with a landing page.
  # The default page provides a screen with a link to login by linking to "/home".  To provide an external page/site
  # use the "redirect:url" format.  For example, redirect:http://reporting-site.com
#  landing-page-url: forward:/landing.html
