## User Guide

There are a few documents associated with the user guide:
* [Legacy-Reporting-UserGuide.pdf]. This is the User Guide for the original reporting system.
This system is no longer deployed but this guide is useful for screen shots and remembering the old days.
* [reporting-system-user-guide.docx]. This is the user guide source that provides generic documentation for RDW.
* [reporting-system-user-guide.CA.docx], [addenda.CA.docx]. This is a CA-specific user guide source that focuses on
interim assessments (IAB, ICA) because CA is not (as of 2018-19 school year) using RDW for summative assessments. As a
companion to the CA user guide there is an addenda document that documents the changes to make to the general guide
to make it CA-friendly.
